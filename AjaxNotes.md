# What is AJAX

* Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (JSON is used now more that XML)

* Used to send data asynchronously

* Used to update web pages with data without having to refresh then entire page

* Used with REST APIs which generally return JSON

* Uses XmlHttpRequest() JavaScript function to make the request which creates an object that can then process the response

# XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object

* An API in the form of an object

* Provided by the browsers JavaScript environment

* Provides methods for transferring data between the client and the server

* Can be used with protocols other than HTTP

* Can be used with data other than XML (JSON, text files, etc)
